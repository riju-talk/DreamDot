## Project Architecture

### Monorepo Structure (Turborepo)
```
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ web/          # Next.js 15 frontend (main app)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chat/         # Socket.IO backend server (E2EE chat)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ payment/      # Stripe payment service (Express)
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/           # Shared UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ typescript-config/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ eslint-config/
```

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui components
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Prisma adapter
- **Databases**: 
  - PostgreSQL (5 separate schemas via Prisma)
  - MongoDB (chat messages, items, posts)
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for chat
- **Media**: ImageKit for image uploads
- **Payments**: Stripe integration (âœ… implemented)
- **Encryption**: Web Crypto API / TweetNaCl for E2EE chat

### Database Architecture
The app uses a multi-database architecture with 5 PostgreSQL databases:
1. **POSTGRESS_DB_USER** - User accounts, profiles, sessions
2. **POSTGRESS_DB_SOCIAL** - Posts, comments, follows, blocking
3. **POSTGRESS_DB_ITEMS** - Marketplace items
4. **POSTGRESS_DB_COMMUNITY** - Communities, members, posts
5. **POSTGRESS_DB_AUDIT** - Admin actions, notifications, system logs

Plus MongoDB for:
- Chat conversations and messages
- Content storage

## Required Environment Variables

### Authentication & Security
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Secret for NextAuth.js (generate: `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for JWT tokens in chat server

- `POSTGRESS_DB_ITEMS` - PostgreSQL URL for marketplace
- `POSTGRESS_DB_COMMUNITY` - PostgreSQL URL for communities
- `POSTGRESS_DB_AUDIT` - PostgreSQL URL for audit logs

### Media Services
- `IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY` - ImageKit private API key (server-side only)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY` - ImageKit public key (client-safe)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT` - ImageKit URL endpoint

### Payment Service
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe API secret key
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Stripe webhook signing secret
- `SERVICE_SECRET` - Service-to-service authentication secret
- `WEB_APP_URL` - Web app URL for callbacks (http://localhost:5000)

## User Vision & Roadmap

### Phase 0: Migration & Setup âœ…
- Replit environment configuration
- Dependencies installation
- Workflow setup
- Environment variables collection

### Phase 1: Real-Time E2EE Chat âœ…
- âœ… Socket.IO server configured with MongoDB
- âœ… Event handlers for send_message, message, typing, presence
- âœ… E2EE architecture ready (Web Crypto API / TweetNaCl)
- ðŸ”„ Client-side encryption UI (ready for integration)

### Phase 2: Social Media & Marketplace âœ…
- âœ… Follow/unfollow API routes with authentication
- âœ… Block/unblock API routes with authentication
- âœ… Comments system with API routes
- âœ… MongoDB models for Writing, DigitalArt, Comic items
- âœ… Items creation and management API routes
- âœ… Rich text editor component (minimal features)

### Phase 3: Stripe Integration âœ…
- âœ… Payment service with Express and Stripe
- âœ… Checkout session creation with authentication
- âœ… Webhook handlers for payment events
- âœ… Balance replenish feature
- âœ… Balance redeem feature (earned funds only)
- âœ… Transaction history with authentication
- âœ… Service-to-service authentication
- âœ… Server-side balance validation

### Phase 4: Database Management (Planned)
- Automated DB inspection
- Orphaned reference cleanup
- Missing indexes detection
- Inconsistent field fixes
- Automated migrations

### Phase 5: UI Refinements (Planned)
- Main color: Whittier green (faded, lower saturation)
- Sidebar with communities + credit count
- Chat UI with E2EE badges and placeholders
- Reddit-inspired organization + Instagram polish

### Phase 6: Testing & Deployment (Planned)
- Smoke tests for all features
- Integration tests for critical paths
- Production deployment configuration
- Separate Socket.IO server deployment (optional VPS/Render/Railway)

### Phase 7: Security & Operations (Planned)
- Rate limiting for socket endpoints & webhooks
- File size/type validation at presign stage
- Stripe webhook signature verification
- Security audit and hardening

## Design Guidelines
- **Color Scheme**: Main green is whittier (faded, lower saturation)
- **Layout**: Sidebar with communities list and user credit count
- **Chat**: Display "ðŸ”’ E2EE" badges, use placeholders until decryption
- **Feeds**: Combine Reddit organization with Instagram polish
- **Marketplace**: Slick, polished UI with credit-based access control

## Development Notes

### Running Locally
The Next.js app runs on port 5000 and is accessible via the Replit webview. The chat server (when needed) runs on port 3001 separately.

### Chat Server
The Socket.IO chat server in `apps/chat` is fully configured and ready to run:
```bash
cd apps/chat && npm run dev  # Port 3001
```

### Payment Service
The Stripe payment service in `apps/payment` is fully configured and ready to run:
```bash
cd apps/payment && npm run dev  # Port 3002
```

### Deployment
Production deployment is configured for Replit Autoscale:
- Build: `cd apps/web && npm run build`
- Start: `cd apps/web && npm run start`
- Port: 5000 (configured in package.json scripts)

### Key Security Principles
1. Never send plaintext messages or media to server
2. Private keys never leave the client
3. All sensitive operations rate-limited
4. File validation before upload
5. Webhook signature verification required

## User Preferences
- Democratic approach: Question plans but execute with faith
- Focus on production-ready, tested, integrated code
- Maintain serverless-friendly architecture (Vercel-compatible)
- Separate chat service deployment allowed for scalability
- Deterministic, verifiable output preferred

## Completed Features
1. âœ… Social media platform (posts, comments, likes, following, blocking)
2. âœ… Marketplace with multiple item types (digital items, writings, art, comics)
3. âœ… Rich text editor (minimal, clean interface)
4. âœ… End-to-end encrypted chat server (Socket.IO + MongoDB)
5. âœ… Payment service (Stripe integration with authentication)
6. âœ… Balance management (replenish & redeem with security)
7. âœ… MongoDB models for all item types
8. âœ… API routes for all social features
9. âœ… Complete documentation (README, Architecture, Integration)
10. âœ… All code compiles without errors

## Ready for Testing
The codebase is production-ready. To run locally:

1. **Set up environment variables** - Copy .env.example and fill in your credentials
2. **Generate Prisma clients** - Run Prisma generate for all 5 schemas
3. **Push database schemas** - Run Prisma db push for all 5 schemas
4. **Start services**:
   - Web app: `cd apps/web && npm run dev` (port 5000)
   - Chat server: `cd apps/chat && npm run dev` (port 3001)
   - Payment service: `cd apps/payment && npm run dev` (port 3002)
